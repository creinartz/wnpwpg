this repository contains the demo files for the responsive web design presentation "was nicht passt wird wird responsive gemacht" which i did in april 2014 at the php user group d√ºsseldorf.

you can find the slides from the presentation here:
http://de.slideshare.net/ChristophReinartz/was-nicht-passt-wird-responsive-gemacht

part one of the live demo presentation was to show up how to use em based values for your fonts. the em/px example pages have exactly the same content and are displayed the same on all browsers.
i demonstrated how to calculate the em-values and showed up how to scale the font-size via a single font-size change on e.g. the body-element with the em-demo

the second live demo in the presentation was to show how to transform a simple static page in a responsive one. the static and responsive sites have the same markup but with only some media-queries and some other css-changes we can make it responsive.
